# Cardheko - used car price prediction
This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars using machine learning regression techniques. The dataset, scraped from the Car Dheko website, contains both numerical and categorical features related to used cars, which were initially uncleaned and required thorough preprocessing. Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using K-fold cross-validation to determine the best performing model. Among these, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and high R square score.
